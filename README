How to use pypodder:

* Put pypodder.py in a directory of your choice.
* Create a file named pypodder.conf in the same directory, and put the URIs of 
  the RSS feeds to the podcasts you want to subscribe to in this file - one per 
  line.
* Have a look at the configuration variables at the top of pypodder.py. You will
  probably want to change DEST_DIR in particular - the directory where podcast 
  files will be downloaded to.

Now you're set. Either run pypodder.py manually or add cronjob / scheduled task
that runs it at whatever interval you desire.
